    Dear \ifundef{\chairlastname}{Members of the Search Committee}{\chairlastname and Members of the Search Committee},

I am writing to apply for the position of \position.
I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science at Cornell University, with an expected graduation date of May 2024.
Advised by Prof. Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, I work at the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science.
I am passionate about teaching and mentorship, and I believe that this passion plus my experience as an instructor and research mentor (detailed in my CV and statements) make me an excellent fit for \schoolname.

\ifliberalarts
My views on teaching have been shaped by my Liberal Arts background: my undergraduate experience at Harvey Mudd College showed me firsthand the value of an education that focuses on students as individuals.
\coverteachingpara
\else
As an instructor, I would bring to the table a teaching philosophy shaped by my unique combination of teaching experiences: namely, starting as a TA in a small-classroom setting during my undergraduate studies at Harvey Mudd College, then going on to teach large (200+ student) courses during my graduate career at Cornell.
This background, plus my other teaching experience in non-classroom settings (detailed in my Teaching Statement), makes me flexible enough to teach different kinds of courses as needed.
I am most passionate about teaching foundational CS courses, such as \schoolintrocourses.
At the same time, I am also qualified to teach higher-level courses related to my research interests, such as \schooladvcourses.

% research paragraph
\ifliberalarts
My research also embodies the interdisciplinary spirit of the Liberal Arts: I study online community governance and content moderation from a combined technical and social perspective.
\else
My research agenda is well-suited to working with undergraduate students, including those with multidisciplinary interests: I study online community governance and content moderation from a combined technical and social perspective.
\fi
On the technical side, I develop novel computational models of online interaction that can help identify situations at risk of escalating into toxic or offensive behavior.
On the social side, I collaborate with real online communities to evaluate how this technology could help their users have healthier online interactions.
This focus on real-world applications opens up opportunities for undergraduate students to contribute in both software development and research design, as shown by the experiences of the six undergraduate and three masters students I have mentored---including one undergraduate who led a major user study and was first author on the resulting peer-reviewed academic conference paper.

Included in my application are the following materials: \materials
For references, you may contact Profs. Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Karen Levy, and Peter Enns from Cornell University.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

\closing{Sincerely,}
