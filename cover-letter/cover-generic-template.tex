\opening{Dear \chairlastname,}

I am writing to apply for the position of \position.
I am currently a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Cornell University, and I expect to receive my PhD in May 2024.
I am a US citizen and am currently based at Cornell's main campus in Ithaca, NY.
I am advised by Prof. Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, conducting research on how natural language processing and machine learning can be applied to create novel computational tools for content moderation that can concretely benefit real online communities.
I am passionate about teaching and mentorship, and I believe that this passion plus my experience as an instructor and research mentor make me an excellent fit for \schoolname.

\ifliberalarts
My views on teaching have been shaped by my Liberal Arts background: my undergraduate experience at Harvey Mudd College allowed me to experience firsthand the value of an education that focuses on students as individuals.

% research paragraph
\ifliberalarts
My combined technical and social research agenda involves designing novel computational models of online interaction that can help identify situations at risk of escalating into toxic or offensive behavior, and working together with real online communities to identify ways this technology could help them address their moderation challenges.
I see this unique combination as an ideal fit for the interdisciplinary and integrated nature of a Liberal Arts education.
\coverresearchpara
My focus on real-world applications opens up opportunities for undergraduate students to contribute in both software development and research design, as shown by the experiences of the six undergraduate and five masters students I have mentored---one of whom led a major user study and was first author on the resulting peer-reviewed academic conference paper.
I look forward to continuing this successful track record of research mentorship through working with the talented student researchers at \schoolname.

Included in my application are the following materials: \materials
For references, you may contact Profs. Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil, Karen Levy, and Peter Enns from Cornell University.
I would be happy to discuss my application with you in more detail.
Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing back from you.

\closing{Sincerely,}
