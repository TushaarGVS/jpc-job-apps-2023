## Summary

I am passionate about teaching and mentorship at the undergraduate level.
I have taught one undergraduate CS course as co-instructor of record, additionally TA'd six CS courses across nine semesters of my undergraduate and graduate careers, and designed and taught various data science workshops.
I have also been a research mentor for six undergraduate students.

My research involves working with real online communities to design and evaluate computational tools for content moderation and community governance.
It has been published in top venues for both natural language processing (ACL, EMNLP) and computational social science (WWW, CSCW).

## Teaching Experience

<div class="dummy_space"></div>

### Courses Taught

`Spring 2023`
**CS4300 - Information and Language**
- *Cornell University*
- This was a 200-person course open to both computer science and information science undergraduates, covering selected topics in information retrieval, machine learning, and natural language processing. As co-instructor of record, I updated and taught lectures on the machine learning topics, reorganized some assignments to better spread out the workload, designed exam questions, and oversaw the development of new infrastructure for the course project to make it more approachable for students with less technical background.


### Workshops Taught

`Summer 2022`
**Introduction to Python Bootcamp**
- *Cornell Center for Social Sciences*
- I co-developed and co-instructed this brand-new workshop designed to introduce Python to social science researchers with little to no prior programming experience. It covers the basics of the Python language, explains key debugging skills, and introduces core data science packages.

`Spring 2022`
**Using APIs for Social Science Research**
- *Cornell Center for Social Sciences*
- I co-developed this brand-new workshop that explains what APIs are and demos how to use an API to fetch different kinds of social media data.

`Fall 2021`
**Introduction to Git and GitHub**
- *Cornell Center for Social Sciences*
- This workshop covers the basics of version control and how it can both help researchers keep their code organized and promote reproducibility in research. I updated it with new visual explanations of key Git concepts to make it more approachable for first-time Git users.


### Courses TA'd

`Fall 2017`
**CS4700 - Foundations of Artificial Intelligence**, *Cornell University*

`Spring 2017`
**CS151 - Artifical Intelligence**, *Harvey Mudd College*

`Fall 2017`
**CS140 - Algorithms**, *Harvey Mudd College*

`Spring 2016`
**CS131 - Programming Languages**, *Harvey Mudd College*

`Fall 2014-16`
**CS70 - Data Structures and Program Development**, *Harvey Mudd College*
- Head TA during the Fall 2015 semester

`Spring 2014`
**CS60 - Principles of Computer Science**, *Harvey Mudd College*
