\vspace{0.5\baselineskip}
One of the biggest problems facing online platforms today is the prevalence of incivility, harassment, hate speech, and other similar behaviors---collectively referred to in social science as ``antisocial behavior''.
While a lot of Computer Science research has responded to this problem by developing algorithms to detect antisocial behavior, I argue that this approach implicitly centers the perspective of platform owners, who would be in a position to employ these algorithms for moderation, and fails to center an equally important perspective: that of the \emph{communities} of ordinary people who interact on these platforms.
Therefore, my research focuses on the following question: how can technology help online communities to maintain norms and negotiate disputes---in other words, to \emph{proactively} prevent antisocial behavior from taking root?
I tackle this question through a combined social and technical research agenda, in which I have engaged with real online communities to gain novel insights about their needs, pioneered new algorithmic methods to address those needs, and followed up with those communities to collaboratively evaluate my new algorithmic methods and identify future directions for research.

\section{Background: The Landscape of Moderation}

%Popular discourse on content moderation tends to focus on the practices of social media companies, who often employ moderators to remove content deemed to be in violation of their (often opaque) rules.
%Yet a growing body of scholarship in social science and human-computer interaction argues that moderation actually encompasses a much richer body of practices extending all the way down to the community level \cite{brewer_inclusion_2020,seering_reconsidering_2020}.
While moderation is commonly thought of as the purview of social media companies, who often employ moderators to remove content deemed to be in violation of their rules, social and political scientists have long recognized that many online communities also self-organize some less formal moderation practices \cite{grimmelmann_virtues_2015}.
This community-driven moderation is often organized by volunteers, who play a role akin to a community leader \cite{seering_reconsidering_2020}.
But these volunteer moderators do not act alone: they also involve ordinary community members in the moderation process, by engaging with the community to promote rule-following behavior through steps like publicly modeling good behavior, educating community members about the rules, and mediating discussions that are getting out of hand \cite{billings_understanding_2010,seering_shaping_2017}.
These practices can be seen as \emph{proactive} moderation aimed at discouraging antisocial behavior from occurring at all---in contrast to \emph{reactive} moderation practices like content removal which respond to antisocial behavior after it occurs.



%Leveraging these logs, I conducted a data-driven analysis of how moderators interact with the editors whom they temporarily block, presented at the 2019 Web Conference (WWW 2019) \cite{chang_trajectories_2019}.
%A key finding was the importance of two-way trust in this relationship: blocked editors can signal trust in the moderator by acknowledging their wrongdoing (as measured through handwritten rules that detect actions such as apologies) while moderators can signal trust in the editor by granting requests for reduced block duration.
%Both such strategies are correlated with an increased likelihood of future rule-following by the blocked editor, showing how building trust may be a key factor in proactively fostering a prosocial, norm-adhering culture within an online community.


%These results point to an important aspect of community-driven moderation: it is very much a \emph{collaborative} project, one in which regular community members are not merely passive observers but instead play a direct role.
%Regular community members actively choose to accept---or not---the authority of volunteer moderators and the norms they promote, and may directly communicate their (un)acceptance to the moderators themselves.
%Volunteer moderators, for their part, seek to bolster their relationship of mutual trust with the community; in doing so, they may make community members more willing to adhere to rules and norms, thereby proactively reducing the likelihood of antisocial behavior.
%But how is this concretely achieved?
%My preceding data-driven analysis only reveals one strategy, the granting of clemency, which is applicable only in specific circumstances.
%Gaining a more complete picture of proactive moderation work requires taking a more holistic approach to analyzing the work of volunteer moderators as seen directly from their own perspectives.

%These results illuminate the collaborative nature of community-driven moderation: regular community members are a key contributor to the functioning of the system, as its success requires their buy-in and trust, which moderators in turn must foster.
%But besides grating clemency---which is a highly situational, niche strategy---how do volunteer moderators bolster their relationship with their community and proactively encourage prosocial behavior?
%To answer this question, I conducted interviews with Wikipedia moderators, in work published at the 2022 ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW 2022) \cite{schluger_proactive_2022}.
%These interviews focused on the proactive side of volunteer moderators' work, asking questions about moderators reason about the likelihood of a stiuation deteriorating into antisocial behavior, and what kinds of proactive steps they take to prevent such outcomes.
%From the responses, a clear picture emerges of how volunteer moderators can tell when conflicts between Wikipedia editors are at risk of veering away from healthy disagreement and towards antisocial behavior, and the strategies they employ to get things back on track.

%To gain a broader view of proactive moderation strategies, I turned to interviews with Wikipedia moderators, which formed the basis of work presented at the 2022 ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW 2022) \cite{schluger_proactive_2022}.
%All moderators in the interviews reported that they have some intuition for when a discussion is at risk of derailing into personal attacks or other prohibited antisocial behaviors.
%Furthermore, they described how when they discover such at-risk discussions, they may intervene to gently steer the conversation back on track, through techniques such as offering to mediate the disagreement.

\section{My Research Contributions}
My research aims to fill a gap in the existing Computer Science research on content moderation: while there has been a lot of work on computational tools to assist reactive moderation, such as algorithms to detect antisocial content and flag it for removal, I focus instead on the relatively understudied question of how computational methods can assist community-driven proactive moderation.

\subsection{Identifying Community Moderators' Needs}
When developing technology meant to help a particular group, it is good practice to hear the perspective of people from that group and let them explain their needs in their own words.
Following this practice, I conducted interviews with volunteer moderators, with an emphasis on understanding how they reason about mediating discussions that are getting out of hand; this work was done alongside undergraduate student Charlotte Schluger and presented at the 2022 ACM Conference on Computer-Supported Collaborative Work (CSCW 2022; a top venue for research on online communities) \cite{schluger_proactive_2022}.
These interviews revealed that moderators can often intuitively tell if a discussion is at risk of later derailing into antisocial behavior and therefore in need of intervention---that is, they are able to \emph{forecast} derailment---but feel challenged by the sheer scale of their communities, often missing opportunities to intervene because there are too many discussions to keep track of.
They subsequently expressed a desire for effective computational tools to aid in this process.
We posit that meeting this need requires an algorithm that can forecast derailment much like human moderators do; such an algorithm could supplement existing community-driven moderation practices, such as by automatically serving reminders of the rules (mimicking a strategy used by human moderators) when an at-risk discussion is detected.


\subsection{Demonstrating the Feasibility of Algorithmically Forecasting Derailment}
To demonstrate that forecasting conversational derailment is a feasible task for computers, I developed two experiments which respectively studied algorithmic estimates of impoliteness and misperception, both of which are factors theorized by socio-linguistics literature to be associated with tension and conflict.
The experiments, conducted in collaboration with industry partners, found that when these factors were present early in a discussion, as measured by machine learning models, the discussion was at statistically significantly higher risk of future derailment.
These results were respectively presented at 2018 Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2018) \cite{zhang_conversations_2018} and the 2020 Web Conference (WWW 2020) \cite{chang_dont_2020}, both top venues for research applying natural language processing to computational social science.

\subsection{Practical Forecasting of Conversational Derailment}
Classical machine learning approaches to natural language processing 
(like those in my earlier proof-of-concept work) 
typically operate on a fixed snapshot of a discussion, assuming it will never change.
But this is impractical for forecasting derailment in real moderation settings, because online discussions actually evolve over time, and each new comment may increase or decrease the risk of derailment.
Thus, a practically useful algorithm would need to follow a conversation in real time, continuously updating its belief about whether the conversation is at risk of derailment.
In work presented at the ACL's 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2019; a hub for debuting novel natural language models) \cite{chang_trouble_2019}, I was able to develop such an algorithm, a neural network known as CRAFT, by adapting techniques from the domain of dialog modeling (aka ``chatbots'') \cite{serban_building_2016}, where similar practical challenges are present.
Experiments on conversations from real online communities show that 77\% of discussions that actually derail are correctly detected by CRAFT (a standard machine learning evaluation metric known as recall); conversely, across all conversations where CRAFT predicts derailment, 64\% in fact go on to derail (a metric known as precision).

\subsection{Using Forecasting Algorithms to Support Online Communities}
While CRAFT scores highly on standard machine learning metrics, these metrics do not necessarily translate into actual usefulness for humans.
To evaluate how forecasting algorithms like CRAFT can concretely benefit real online communities, I led a team of undergraduate and masters students to develop a prototype tool, ConvoWizard, that uses CRAFT to automatically warn users when a discussion they are replying to may be at risk of derailing into antisocial behavior.
ConvoWizard is now being tested in a series of user studies that were set up in collaboration with real online communities, ensuring that testing is done in a way that is respectful of community norms.

Though this work is still in progress, preliminary results published in CSCW 2022 \cite{chang_thread_2022} already offer promising signs of ConvoWizard's potential to improve online discussions.
Upon seeing warnings from ConvoWizard, users in the study tended to edit their comments in ways that decrease the risk of derailment (as estimated by CRAFT), unlike in a control condition where edits tended to increase the risk.
A linguistic analysis of the resulting comments showed that they exhibit increased use of known conflict avoidance strategies, such as adopting a more formal tone and asking questions.
Finally, in a feedback survey ConvoWizard users left largely positive evaluations of the tool: most notably, 54\% reported that ConvoWizard made them rethink posting a comment they might have later regretted, and 83\% expressed interest in long-term use of a ConvoWizard-style tool if it became publicly available.
%, and 64\% felt that if ConvoWizard were deployed at scale, the net effect would be an improvement in discussion quality.

\section{Future Directions}
I am a firm believer in the principle that before new technologies can be broadly adopted, we must first try to understand as fully as possible its ramifications for society and its potential risks.
%This is especially vital for work relating to content moderation, which is quickly becoming a major societal issue with implications for online safety, free speech, and social justice.
In line with this principle, the social aspect of my prior and ongoing work has been tailored towards understanding the impact of tools based on forecasting algorithms, so that any future large-scale deployment of such technology can be done in a responsible and ethical manner.
While the findings thus far have offered positive signs about the potential of this technology to improve online discussions, they also raise new questions about its limitations and possible improvements, which are the focus of my future plans.

\subsection{Improving the Transparency of Forecasting Algorithms}
The most common complaint we received in the ConvoWizard exit survey was that the tool lacked \emph{transparency}: when the tool reports that a discussion might be at risk of derailment, it does not explain why this might be the case.
Users reported that this sometimes made it difficult to decide how they should respond, especially in cases where they disagreed with ConvoWizard's judgment.
Solving this problem will likely form the central focus of my research in the immediate future, and to this end I have already begun preliminary work to explore possible directions.
During Summer 2023, I worked with two undergraduate students to design new studies that will investigate how humans tend to judge the risk of derailment and what they would find helpful in an explanation of this risk.
I plan to use the insights from these studies, in combination with the latest technical innovations in explainable AI and text generation, to guide the development of next-generation conversational forecasting algorithms that can automatically generate human-readable explanations of their forecasts.

%But the transparency issue is not just a technical problem: it also ties in to the larger \emph{social} problem of algorithmic bias.
%By now, it has become well known that data-driven approaches are vulnerable to capturing biases embedded within the data.
%The question, then, is not whether forecasting algorithms like CRAFT contain biases---the answer is surely yes---but rather what kinds of biases exist and what their impact would be in a broadly deployed forecasting-based tool.
%This is uncharted territory, since most prior work on computational tools for moderation---and by extension, the analyses of their biases---focused on the reactive paradigm, and it is not clear how those findings might apply to proactive moderation.
%Like the rest of my research agenda, my plan for addressing this question is to take a combined social and technical approach.
%Once an explainable successor to CRAFT has been developed, my plan is to analyze the model's decisions through the lens of recent work from computational social science on codifying the social and power implications found in natural language \cite{sap_social_2020}.
%Cross-referencing this work with the model's decision-making processes could reveal, for instance, whether the algorithm is less sensitive to attacks towards specific underrepresented groups.
%And once such biases are identified, the same insights from social science could be applied to design ways to counter them.

\subsection{Incorporating Non-linguistic Context}
The models I have developed thus far look only at the linguistic content of the conversation itself to forecast whether the conversation will derail.
In practice, however, the trajectory of a conversation often depends on factors beyond what is directly said in the comments; for example, prior work has shown that a community member's willingness to adhere to community norms is influenced by how long they have been part of the community \cite{danescu-niculescu-mizil_no_2013}.
I am interested in investigating how recent breakthroughs in so-called multimodal models---that is, models capable of combining language data with other modes of input---could be adapted to enable forecasting algorithms to incorporate this non-linguistic context.
This is particularly important because antisocial behavior is highly dependent on social context, and phenomena such as microaggressions and dogwhistles can alienate members of marginalized groups from a community despite not being overtly ``toxic''.
Building on recent efforts to computationally model the social and power implications found in natural language \cite{sap_social_2020} could make forecasting algorithms more sensitive to social context, and thereby allow them to better serve marginalized groups.
%, reducing bias and improving equity in community-driven moderation.


\subsection{Measuring Longer-term Impacts of Proactive Moderation Tools}
Evaluations of ConvoWizard thus far have focused on the tool's immediate impact: that is, how seeing a warning when replying to an at-risk discussion impacts the user's behavior while writing the reply.
Looking forward, I also wish to understand what longer-term impacts such tools might have.
At a whole-conversation level, we might ask whether a reply that was written with the help of ConvoWizard might lead to more pro-social behavior throughout the rest of the conversation, even among participants who don't have ConvoWizard.
At a community level, we might investigate how forecasting algorithms can be adapted into tools that serve volunteer moderators and aid them in their community leadership practices (alongside, or as alternatives to, ConvoWizard-style tools that serve ordinary community members).
Answering these questions will require larger-scale, longer-term user studies, offering a prime opportunity for students to gain extended exposure to both computational social science research and the underlying software development challenges.

\section{Involving Undergraduates in my Research Agenda}
Throughout my research, I have had the pleasure and privilege of collaborating with several undergraduate students, who have contributed to my research agenda in a number of ways.
Most notably, two of my papers---the two CSCW papers---were co-authored with undergraduate student Charlotte Schluger, who is in fact first author on one of them.
She had the distinction of contributing through the entire research pipeline: she was part of the larger student team that implemented ConvoWizard, was responsible for both designing and conducting the moderator interviews, and finally contributed large portions of the paper writing.
To me, Charlotte's experience illustrates the broad potential of my research agenda for undergraduates: it presents opportunities for both scientific contributions and software engineering contributions, offering valuable experience that is relevant to both academic and industry career paths.
%Moreover, I do not view these aspects as mutually exclusive: I believe that students interested in research can benefit from having to implement research ideas as usable software, and that students interested in going into industry can benefit from exposure to cutting-edge research ideas.

In fact, I have found through my past work with undergraduate students that the software development components of my research agenda offer a solution to one of the biggest challenges in mentoring undergraduates: how to ease them into the world of research in an approachable way.
For many undergraduates starting research for the first time, research can seem intimidating because it is so different from what they have experienced before.
Unlike coursework and internship projects, which involve concrete tasks and clear deliverables, research is often very abstract and lacks clearly defined goals, which can make it hard for even experienced researchers to gauge their progress.
By having new students in my research group start off with concrete software development tasks in projects like ConvoWizard, I am able to provide them a more familiar environment with clear deliverables through which progress can be tracked.
At the same time, as students work on these tasks, they gain exposure to the novel research ideas underlying the software, and hence these tasks serve as an accessible gateway to research.
This is well-illustrated by the experience of my first undergraduate mentee, Andrew Wang, who took an interest in social networks research that he was exposed to in his early work with me, and has since gone on to pursue research in this direction through the MS program at Stanford followed by the PhD program back here at Cornell.

My future research plans offer ample opportunities for me to carry out this mentoring strategy.
In addition to the ongoing ConvoWizard project, my plans for studying longer-term impacts of proactive moderation tools may involve the development of new forecasting-based tools catering to different needs and audiences.
Furthermore, I co-lead the development of ConvoKit (\url{https://convokit.cornell.edu}), an open-source Python package for working with conversational data, which offers additional opportunities for starter projects.
I also believe such projects offer educational value even beyond research.
For one, they often involve concepts that undergraduates are exposed to in their CS coursework---such as class interface design, proper use of data structures, and reasoning about efficiency---and therefore provide a valuable supplement to their classroom learning.
And of course, students interested in industry careers can use these projects to gain valuable software engineering experience, as was the case for my mentee Caleb Chiam, who has become the largest contributor to ConvoKit.
