\title{Statement on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion}

My approach to teaching, as I have laid out in my teaching statement, is to start by thinking about the course and the material from a student's perspective.
It is important to me that when I do this, I truly account for \emph{all} of my students---which inherently requires that I consider perspectives that may be wildly different from my own (cis-gendered, male, middle-class, able-bodied) perspective.
Consequently, a central tenet of my teaching is addressing the challenges in diversity, equity, and inclusion that CS as a field continues to face.
I think about this not only through the lens of building a more inclusive classroom, but also at a higher level: promoting equity and inclusion in the community I belong to (whether that be my undergraduate institution Harvey Mudd, my graduate institution Cornell, or, looking ahead, \schoolname), and training students who will broadly advance this cause in their future careers.

\section{Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Classroom}
At the most direct level, accounting for diverse student backgrounds in my teaching implies taking steps to design a course environment that is accessible and welcoming to all.
In pursuit of this goal, there are a few concrete strategies I have tried out in my teaching career thus far, both as co-instructor of record for CS4300 ``Information and Language'' and as a designer and instructor of workshops for the Cornell Center for Social Sciences (CCSS).

In my teaching statement, I detailed a number of steps I took in my CS4300 teaching to make existing course structures more inclusive.
One of these was introducing alternative modes of in-class participation, such as online polls and forum-style discussions, so that students who are uncomfortable with speaking in front of the whole class, or unable to do so, nevertheless have ways to contribute their thoughts.
Another step was overseeing the development of a brand new project server and template for the course final project, which abstracted away a lot of the boilerplate parts of app development.
This system helped ensure that students who have not had prior opportunities to practice app development skills were on a more level playing field with those who had such opportunities (e.g., through internships), and made evaluation more fair by helping the course staff focus on the part of the project we actually cared about evaluating, namely the information retrieval aspect.
I believe these efforts were part of why students ultimately rated the course an average 4.44 out of 5 on diversity and inclusion in their end-of-semester evaluations.

More recently, I have come to focus on another diversity-related goal: ensuring that students both know how to ask for help and are comfortable doing so.
I firmly believe knowing how to ask for help---that is, knowing what resources are best for a given problem and how to best word your question---is a learned skill, just like knowing how to code.
Unfortunately, many students view asking for help not as a skill but a weakness, an effect that may be exacerbated among underrepresented groups due to impostor syndrome.
Accordingly, I have started incorporating segments about asking for help into my CCSS workshops, especially those targeted at intro-level programming audiences.
These segments involve not only explaining that I have to seek help myself all the time in my work, but also demonstrating this process as part of the workshop---for instance by showing how to find and interpret documentation online, going over effective strategies for doing targeted web searches about coding errors, and directly asking my co-instructors to offer their ideas.

\section{Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion in the Community}
The work needed to build inclusive learning environments does not stop at the level of individual course design: students' sense of belonging is affected not only by the design of lectures and assignments, but also by whether they feel welcomed by the broader community.
Therefore, another major part of my efforts in diversity, equity, and inclusion is ensuring that the communities I am a part of are welcoming to students of all backgrounds.
