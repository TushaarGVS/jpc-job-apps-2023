\renewcommand{\materials}{my latest CV and statements on teaching and research.\xspace}

\renewcommand{\coverteachingpara}{%
I am drawn to Lafayette because I see this core principle reflected in the design of its CS curriculum.
In particular, I am very interested in Lafayette's topic-based approach to introductory CS (the CS 104, 105, and 106 series), which closely mirrors my own teaching philosophy of anchoring CS concepts in concrete examples and narratives from real-world applications (discussed further in my Teaching Statement).
When it comes to teaching, I am most passionate about foundational CS courses (like \schoolintrocourses), and given my prior experience teaching Data Science workshops to non-CS majors, I would also be excited to teach courses in the Computational Methods program such as CM 151.
Of course, I would also be excited to teach more advanced courses connected to my research interests, such as \schooladvcourses.
Finally, I would love the chance to share my specific research interests, Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science, with Lafayette's students, either through developing new courses or as sections of the Special Topics courses CS 410-415.%

\renewcommand{\coverresearchpara}{%
I believe this research agenda fits well with the Lafayette CS department's applied focus, and that it has roles for CS majors and non-majors (i.e., students pursuing the Computational Methods minor) alike.%
