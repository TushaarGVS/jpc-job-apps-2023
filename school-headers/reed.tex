\renewcommand{\coverteachingpara}{%
I am drawn to Reed because as a Liberal Arts, primarily-undergraduate institution, I know that it shares this core principle.
When it comes to teaching, I am most passionate about foundational CS courses (like \schoolintrocourses).
Of course, I would also be excited to teach more advanced courses connected to my research interests, such as \schooladvcourses.
Finally, I would love the chance to develop new courses to share my specific research interests, Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science, with Reed's students.%
}

\renewcommand{\coverresearchpara}{%
With its connections to other fields like social science, linguistics, and philosophy, this research agenda serves as a prime opportunity for Reed students to explore the applications of their CS education, and is especially well-suited for students pursuing an interdisciplinary major.%
