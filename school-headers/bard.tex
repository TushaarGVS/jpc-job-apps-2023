\renewcommand{\materials}{my latest CV and statements on teaching and research.\xspace}

\renewcommand{\coverteachingpara}{%
I am drawn to Bard because I see this core principle reflected in the design of its CS curriculum.
In particular, I am very interested in Bard's topic-based Introduction to Computing series (CMSC 111-117), whose use of concrete real-world applications to motivate fundamental CS concepts closely mirrors strategies I use in my own teaching (discussed further in my Teaching Statement).
When it comes to teaching, I am most passionate about foundational CS courses, including the aforementioned Introdution to Computing series as well as \schoolintrocourses.
Of course, I would also be excited to teach more advanced courses connected to my research interests, such as \schooladvcourses.
Finally, I would love the chance to share my specific research interests, Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science, with Bard's students, either through developing new courses or as sections of the Advanced AI topics course CMSC 451.%

\renewcommand{\coverresearchpara}{%
This research agenda fits extremely well with Bard's focus on interdisciplinary connections, and complements the research interests of Bard's current CS faculty by uniting work in Artificial Intelligence and Human-Computer Interaction and drawing connections to areas outside CS such as Linguistics and Social Science.%
