\renewcommand{\materials}{my latest CV and statements on teaching and research.\xspace}

\renewcommand{\coverteachingpara}{%
I therefore believe a faculty position at a Liberal Arts institution like \schoolname is the natural next step in my journey as an educator.
When it comes to teaching, I am most passionate about foundational CS courses like \schoolintrocourses.
Of course, I would also be excited to teach more advanced courses connected to my research interests, such as \schooladvcourses.
Finally, I would love the chance to share my specific research interests, Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science, with \schoolname's students, either through developing new courses or as sections of the Special Topics / Advanced Special Topics courses CPSC 370 / 470.%

\renewcommand{\coverresearchpara}{%
This research agenda is an excellent fit for \schoolname, complementing the research interests of \schoolname's current CS faculty by uniting work in Data Science and Human-Computer Interaction and drawing connections to areas outside CS such as Linguistics and Social Science.%
