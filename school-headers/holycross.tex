\renewcommand{\coverteachingpara}{%
As someone whose educational background includes both Liberal Arts and Jesuit (high school at Bellarmine College Prep in San Jose, CA) education, I am particularly drawn to a career at a Liberal Arts, Jesuit institution like \schoolnamelong.
When it comes to teaching, I am most passionate about foundational CS courses such as \schoolintrocourses; I am especially interested in CSCI 110 due to my prior experience teaching programming workshops for non-CS majors.
Of course, I would also be excited to teach more advanced courses connected to my research interests, such as \schooladvcourses.
Finally, I would love the chance to expand the College's course offerings by developing new courses on Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science.%

\renewcommand{\coverresearchpara}{%
With its special focus on real-world impact, I believe this research agenda is a good fit with the Jesuit mission of the \schoolnamelong.%
