\renewcommand{\materials}{my latest CV and statements on teaching and research.\xspace}

\renewcommand{\coverteachingpara}{%
As someone whose educational background includes both Liberal Arts and Jesuit (high school at Bellarmine College Prep in San Jose, CA) education, I am particularly drawn to a career at a Liberal Arts, Jesuit institution like \schoolnamelong.
When it comes to teaching, I am most passionate about foundational CS courses such as \schoolintrocourses; I am especially interested in CSCI 1080 due to my prior experience teaching programming workshops for non-CS majors.
Of course, I would also be excited to teach more advanced courses connected to my research interests, such as \schooladvcourses.
Finally, I would love the chance to expand \schoolname's course offerings by developing new courses on Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science.%

\renewcommand{\coverresearchpara}{%
With its special focus on real-world impact, I believe this research agenda is a good fit with \schoolname's Jesuit mission.%
