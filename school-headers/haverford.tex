\renewcommand{\materials}{my latest CV and statements on teaching and research.\xspace}

\renewcommand{\coverteachingpara}{%
I am drawn to Haverford not only because of its status as a leading Liberal Arts college, but also because of its membership in the Tri-College Consortium with Bryn Mawr and Swarthmore.
This structure is similar to the Claremont Consortium that my alma mater Harvey Mudd is part of, and I know from firsthand experience that this unique setup is very effective at promoting collaboration and interdisciplinary thinking, making for a rich and diverse educational experience which I would be excited to be a part of.
When it comes to teaching, I am most passionate about foundational CS courses (like \schoolintrocourses).
Of course, I would also be excited to teach more advanced courses connected to my research interests, such as \schooladvcourses.
Finally, I would love the opportunity to expand Haverford's course offerings by developing a new course in Computational Social Science, a growing interdisciplinary field that is highly relevant to the Liberal Arts philosophy and would appeal to students across all three colleges in the Consortium.%

\renewcommand{\coverresearchpara}{%
I believe this research agenda fits well with the Haverford CS department's focus on collaborative inquiry.
In pursuing my research agenda at Haverford, I would look forward to the opportunity to work with students from Haverford and the rest of the Tri-College Consortium alike.%
