\renewcommand{\coverteachingpara}{%
I am drawn to Skidmore in part because the design of its CS curriculum reflects this core principle, with its focus on giving students space to pursue electives and research so they can personalize their educational experience.
When it comes to teaching, I am most passionate about foundational CS courses (like \schoolintrocourses), and in particular given my prior experience teaching introductory CS workshops to non-CS audiences, I would be quite interested in teaching Skidmore's unique ``Computing in Context'' courses (CS 102 series).
Of course, I would also be excited to teach more advanced courses connected to my research interests, such as \schooladvcourses.
Finally, I would love the chance to share my specific research interests, Natural Language Processing and Computational Social Science, with Skidmore's students, either through developing new courses or as sections of the Advanced Topics course CS 376.%

\renewcommand{\coverresearchpara}{%
I believe this research agenda fits well with Skidmore's emerging cross-departmental approach to Artificial Intelligence research and education, which has been led by faculty not only in Computer Science but also Philosophy, Psychology, and English.
In pursuing my research agenda at Skidmore, I would look forward to the opportunity to collaborate in person with both faculty and students from such varied backgrounds.%
