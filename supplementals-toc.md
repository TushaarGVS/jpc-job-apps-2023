# Supplemental Materials: Teaching Evaluations

## Jonathan P. Chang

### Summary

This document contains a compilation of teaching evaluations I have received as co-instructor of record for CS4300 and as co-instructor of the Python workshop series for the Cornell Center for Social Sciences (CCSS). It is intended as a supplement to my main application materials.

### Description of Contents

* **CS4300 Midterm Evaluations (Pg. 2)**: These evaluations were conducted during the middle of the semester, and are provided here in their raw form (i.e., exactly as they were given to me by the department). Note that it contains evaluations for both instructors (myself and co-instructor Cristian Danescu-Niculescu-Mizil), but the results are displayed separately per instructor.

* **CS4300 Final Evaluations (Pg. 15)**: These evaluations were conducted right before the end of the semester, and are provided here in their raw form (i.e., exactly as they were given to me by the department). Unlike the midterm evaluations, the attached results are instructor-specific and therefore only contain evaluations of me. However, please be aware that several questions in the evaluation pertain to the course as a whole, and therefore may still conflate elements of my teaching and my co-instructor's. I recommend focusing on the questions that were specifically worded as asking about "the lecturer", as these are the most likely to contain feedback that is specific to my teaching.

* **CS4300 ALI Survey (Pg. 44)**: Free-text responses from a supplementary survey distributed by the Cornell Active Learning Institute, which specifically asks for student feedback on the various interactive strategies we implemented in the course, as well as the project server and template (discussed in my Teaching Statement).

* **CCSS Python Workshop Feedback (Pg. 51)**: Student feedback from the CCSS Python Workshop Series that I designed and co-instructed in Summer 2022.
